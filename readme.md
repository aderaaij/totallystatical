## 👩‍💻 Usage 
Clone this package to a local folder and run `npm install` to install all the node dependencies.

### Development mode
To start developing, run `gulp` from the terminal. This default command will build all your assets in development mode, starts the watch command and a browsersync server which is available on `127.0.0.1:3000`.

### Production
Run `gulp build:production` to build your production app. This will build and minify your assets into the `/app/build` folder. This will also add a hash to your assets for cachebusting purposes. You can run `gulp server` to start an express server from the buildfolder at anytime. 

### Deployment
Run either `gulp deloy:ftp` or `gulp deply:sftp` to deploy through FTP or SFTP. To configure, create a `.ftppass.json` file in the root of your project(see `.ftppass-example`)  and fill in the right details. In either `/gulpfile.js/tasks/deployFTP` or `/gulpfile.js/tasks/deploySFTP`, rename the line `var ftppass = require('../../.ftppass-example')` to `var ftppass 			= require('../../.ftppass')` and deploy like the wind.

## Tasks
All tasks are defined in `gulpfile.js/tasks`. Most tasks have a corresponding config file in `gulpfile.js/config`. Some share a config file and some just use `gulpfile.js/index.js`

### 🏃🏽‍ default
Cleans, builds app and enables watch tasks

### 🏗️ build:production
Builds app with minified assets. Runs the following tasks:
* [`clean`](#clean)
* [`images`](#images)
* [`styles:production`](#stylesproduction)
* [`webppack:production`](#scripts)
* [`templates`](#templates)

### 👀 watch 

Run `gulp watch` to start webserver, watch files and livereload with browsersync. Uses the `gulp-watch` plugin to correctly handle new files while watching.

Runs the tasks:
* [`browsersync`](#browsersync)
* [`setwatch`](#setwatch)
* [`templates`](#templates)

Uses:
* `gulp-watch`

### 🗑 clean
Deletes entire build folder.

Plugins:
* `del` plugin

### 📷 images 
Minifies images and distributes them to the build asset folder

Plugins:
* `gulp-images`
* `gulp-changed`

### 👯 svg:sprites
Create a SVG sprite from icons in the configured folder

Plugins:
* `gulp-images`
* `gulp-svgstore`

### 👀 webpack:watch
Watches, prefixes, compiles, minifies and all the other magical JS things.
* `webpack`
* `babel-preset-env`

### 👀 webpack:production
Prefixes, compiles, hashes, minifies and all the other magical JS things
* `webpack`
* `babel-preset-env`

### 💃 styles 
Compile `/sass` folder to css, autoprefix and add sourcemaps for debugging. In the corresponding config file it's possible to define node modules with `includePaths` to easily define them with `@imports` in your .scss file. By default, the following paths are added:

* `./node_modules/normalize-scss/sass/`
* `./node_modules/susy/sass/`
* `./node_modules/breakpoint-sass/stylesheets/`

Plugins:
* `gulp-sass`
* `gulp-sourcemaps`
* `gulp-autoprefixer`
* `gulp-if`

### 💃 styles:production
Compile `/sass` to css and autoprefix. Doesn't minify as the css files will be rev'ed and minified after compilation.

Plugins:
* `gulp-sass`
* `gulp-autoprefixer`

### 🐶 templates
Generates html files from pug template. Every pug template prefixed with an underscore will not be built into a html file. To speed up the templating process `gulp-pug-inheritance` is used to check which template is dependent on which partial.

Plugins:
* `gulp-pug`
* `gulp-pug-inheritance`
* `gulp-changed`
* `gulp-if`
* `gulp-filter`

### ⚡️ browsersync
Start browsersync server

Plugins:
* `browser-sync`

### ➡️👀 setwatch 
Sets a global `isWatching` variable to `true`. Use to execute certain tasks, functions or configurations only when `gulp watch` is running.

## 💾 Server
Start an express server on `localhost:5000` from the build folder. Convinient for checking out your production site

## 🕷️🕸️ Bugs and to-do's

* configure 'reving' of assets in a foolproof way
* Add a build task without any revisioning / cache busting.
* Create a data task: https://github.com/aderaaij/totallystatical/issues/6
* Fix linking in a completely foolproof way: https://github.com/aderaaij/totallystatical/issues/4

## 🚨 Changelog

### v2.4.0
**22/09/2017**
* ⚒ Switched the `babel-preset-2015`, etc. for `babel-preset-env` which makes it way easier to compile for specific browsers. See https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env
* ⚒ Added presets to the webpack `UglifyJsPlugin`. Now removes `console.log` calls and comments (might have removed comments before, I'm not sure)
* ⚒ Removed the 'standalone scripts' task, as it was weird running scripts through two different compilers. This should be done with webpack instead. Webpack doesn't support multiple outputs out of the box, but luckily there's a way around this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/45278943/4474075. Easy to configure in the `gulpfile.js/config/scripts.js` file. 
* ⚒ Removed unused packages
* ⚒ Cleaned up the gulpfile tasks and config files

### v2.3.2
**10/09/2017**
